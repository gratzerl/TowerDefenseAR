# Tower Defense AR Game
This is a simple tower defense augmented reality game, implemented using only Unity (2019.4.21f1) and Vuforia.

Before the game starts, a random path is generated between the start and end markers. Other markers can be used to place the defender objects 
which will attack an enemy within their reach of action. The game is over when either the player has no more lives left or all enemies have been killed.

This project is still in development and the following things will be worked on next:
  - [ ] Only enable the start button, when both start and end markers are being tracked correctly
  - [x] Fix weird projectile behaviour
  - [ ] Optimise the parameters for the enemy spawn time and the gap between projectiles
  - [x] Replace prototype models with prettier ones
  - [x] UI polishing
